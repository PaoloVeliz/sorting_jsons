# sorting_jsons
a project made for levelup exams


##HOW TO USE IT 

inside the project its only a python file named "main.py" you can open it and you will see a test dictionary, you can do as many as you want but to prove them yo have to put them into the KeysAndValues function. Then you have to execute the file, also i left a requirements.txt if youre using venv to exec it.
